description: In this collection our feisty mascot WuShock is depicted in images selected from the University Archives. WSU's sports teams were known as the Wheatshockers as early as 1904 when the football team took on the name due to many of its players working on farms shocking or harvesting wheat during the summer.  The nickname came to life in 1948 when the WuShock character was created.
